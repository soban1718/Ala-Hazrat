[1] He was the grandson and successor of Sheikh Baha-ud-din Zakariya. Shah Rukn-e-Alam died on Friday, the 7th of Jumada al-awwal 735 Hijri (3 January 1335). He was buried in the mausoleum of his grandfather, according to his own will.

who was his Ataleeq-e-Awwal, Khalifa-e-Awwal and was married to his aunt, the daughter of Sheikh Baha-ud-Din Zakariya.
</p>

<h1 id="4">Baha Ud Adeen Zakariya</h1>
<p> Abu Muhammad Bahauddin Zakariya, later known simply as Bahauddin Zakariya, was born around 1170 CE in Kot Kehror (now known as Karor Lal Esan), a town near the ancient city of Multan, in the southern part of the Punjab province of modern Pakistan. His grandfather, Shah Kamal-ud-Din Ali Shah Qureshi, had arrived in Multan from Mecca, Arabia while en route to the Khwarezm region of Central Asia.[4]
Bahauddin Zakariya descended from the lineage of Asad Ibn Hashim, and was hence a Hashmi, or direct descendant of the same clan lineage as Muhammad.
The renowned Kurdish-Persian Sufi master Shahab al-Din Abu Hafs Umar Suhrawardi of Baghdad awarded Zakariya the spiritual title Caliph in Baghdad, and then assigned him back to the Multan region,[1]
For fifteen years, Zakariya travelled to different cities in southern Punjab, where the order was able to attract large numbers of converts from Hinduism.[5] Zakariya finally settled in Multan in 1222.[6] Under his influence, Multan became known as "Baghdad of the East," and is referred by Zakariya in his Persian :
Multan ma ba jannat a'la barabara Ahista pa ba-nah ke malik sajda mi kunad.
("Multan of ours is comparable to the great Paradise", "Tread slowly, the angels are paying obeisance here.")
Zakariya became a vocal critic of Multan's ruler at the time, Nasir-ud-Din Qabacha, and sided with Iltutmish, the Mamluk Sultan of Delhi when he overthrew Qabacha in 1228.[5] Zakariya's support was crucial for Iltutmish's victory,[7] and so he was awarded the title Shaikh-ul-Islam by Iltutmish to oversee the state's spiritual matters, in gratitude for his support. Zakariya was also granted official state patronage by the Sultan.[5]
During his lifetime, Zakariya befriended Lal Shahbaz Qalandar - a widely revered Sufi saint from Sindh's, and founder of the Qalandariyya order of wandering dervishes. As Shaikh-ul-Islam, Zakariya was able to assuage orthodox Muslims, 
who were offended by the Lal Shahbaz Qalandar's teachings.[8] Zakariya, and Shahbaz Qalandar, together with Baba Fariduddin Ganjshakar of the Chisti order, and Zakariya's disciple Syed Jalalauddin Bukhari, became part of the legendary Haq Char Yaar, or "Four friends" group, which is highly revered among South Asian Muslims.

<h1 id="5">Imam Bari</h1>
<p>Bari Imam was eight years old when his family migrated from Karsal in Chakwal District to what is now Aabpara, Islamabad in Pakistan. According to some sources, he later married and had one daughter, though both women are said to have died prematurely.[2] After their passing, Bari Imam began wandering the forests of the Hazara district in Northern Punjab, where he spent twenty-four years as an ascetic.[2]
Because Bari Imam Sarkar did not transmit any of his doctrines to writing; as such, it may be rightly presumed that he bequeathed all of his teachings orally.[3] Bari Imam went to Ghorghushti in Campbellpur (now known as Attock) where he stayed for two years to learning fiqh, hadith, logic, and other disciplines related to Islam, because at that time Ghorghushti was a great seat of Islamic learning.
Bari Imam was renowned in his own life for being an ascetic who subjected himself to great self-humiliation in the public sphere, "living among the pariahs and consciously exposing himself to the disdain of the people."[2][4]
A celebrated miracle worker, Bari Imam is also described in regional lore as one through whom God performed many marvels to convince the local people of the truth of Islam; thus, some of the most popular miracles ascribed to him are his having caused water to gush forth from rocks and his having brought back to life the dead buffaloes of a peasant who had earlier provided the saint with milk during his ten years of spiritual seclusion

<h1 id="7">Data Darbaar</h1>
<p>The shrine was originally established as a simple grave next to the mosque which Hujwiri had built on the outskirts of Lahore in the 11th century.[1] By the 13th century, the belief that the spiritual powers of great Sufi saints were attached to their burial sites was widespread in the Muslim world,[3] and so a larger shrine was built to commemorate the burial site of Hujwiri during the Mughal period.[1] The shrine complex was expanded in the 19th century, and Hujwiri's mosque rebuilt.
The shrine came under Pakistani government control as part of the Auquf Ordinance of 1960, with the official aim of preventing shrine caretakers throughout the country from financially exploiting devotees.[1] The shrine was greatly expanded in the 1980s under the rule of military dictator Zia ul-Haq,
during which time the shrine became the largest in South Asia. Offices for NGOs, a library, madrasa, police station, carpark, and offices were all added under his regime.
Designated spaces for musical performances, and new free kitchen were also added during that time.[1] New markets have emerged around the site since its massive expansion.[1]
Since 1965, the mehfil-e-sama, a 2-day qawwali music festival, had been held adjacent to the shrine, which in 1992 shifted to a nearby school.
